With basic ped reaction, everyone around the ammunation will be afraid since you're shooting so I added you a little script that will prevent from being attaked by random PNJ or hearing people screaming around.
 
Installation :
Download the Script from the GitHub
Create a new folder for the resource in your server's files.
Place the contents of the GitHub into the folder you just created.

add the line in your server.cfg : 
        start evy_shootingrange
        start evy_safepnj
        
Customise away!
